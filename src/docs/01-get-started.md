title: HarborKnot Components
---
Our goal is to make it easier for teams to design and develop great experiences for users across the web and online applications.

This site is the preview and documentation part of the HarborKnot components. It's where we develop new features and not all components are always stable. For that reason you should **always** reference the latest version of official [HarborKnot Component documentation](https://github.com/Scottie5689/fractal-demo.git).


## What Are We Doing Here?

This is where we'll be putting our components through their pacesâ€”designing, developing, testing, and eventually distributing them as part of the package.

We are using [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) to build and document. Fractal is a component library generator written in Node.js.

- [More about Fractal](http://fractal.build/guide)
- [Fractal Installation guide](http://fractal.build/guide/installation) (Node.js required)

This Repository uses Fractal and Gulp.
