title: HarborKnot Components
---

This is a Fractal starter kit with a simple component and documentation example. Gulp has been installed for compiling assets. Please see the readme file of the repository for the gulp commands.

This kit is ready for continued development and running `npm update` will update your fractal installation and packages to the latest version.

## Why did I build this?

I am a frontend web developer and have been experimenting with component libraries. I am making some of this work public.

## Getting started

This environment is [Fractal](http://fractal.build/). Fractal is a component library generator written in Node.js.
